# Deep Learning Notebooks

## About
Here I'll be publishing my experiments and projects done with 
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
as Jupyter notebook format _.ipynb_.

## Projects
Here is a list of them:
Project Name            | Problem type | Goal                                   |  Accuracy achieved
----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------
USA Used cars           | Regression   | Predict price                          | mae: 3845.8398
Garbage Classification  | CNN          | Classify 6 different types of garbage  | accuracy: 81.91%

More will be added as I'm still learning...
